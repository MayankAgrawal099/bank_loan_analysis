## 📊 What This Notebook Covers

The Python notebook performs detailed exploratory analysis on the bank loan dataset, including:

---

### 🔹 Data Loading & Cleaning

- Importing CSV dataset  
- Basic dataset inspection
- Inspecting Metadata  

---

### 🔹 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- Total loan applications  
- Total funded amount  
- Total amount received  
- Average interest rate  
- Average Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio  

These KPIs provide an overall view of portfolio health.

---

### 🔹 Loan Status Analysis

Loans are categorized into:

- **Good Loans** (Fully Paid / Current)  
- **Bad Loans** (Charged Off)

The notebook analyzes:

- Distribution of good vs bad loans  
- Funded amount by loan quality  
- Amount received by loan quality  

---

### 🔹 Time-Based Trends

Visual analysis of:

- Monthly loan applications  
- Monthly funded amount  
- Monthly repayment trends  

Helps identify seasonal patterns and growth behavior.

---

### 🔹 Borrower Segmentation

Grouped analysis based on:

- Loan term  
- Employment length  
- Loan purpose  
- Home ownership  
- State-wise distribution  

Each segment is visualized to understand borrower behavior and performance.

---

## 📈 Visualizations Included

The notebook generates multiple charts such as:

- Bar charts  
- Line plots  
- Distribution plots  
- Grouped comparisons  

These visuals support business insight extraction.
